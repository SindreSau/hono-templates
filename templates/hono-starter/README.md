# hono-starter Hono Template

This repository contains a basic template for a web application using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This template is designed to provide a quick start for your project, with some additional features that make development easier and more efficient.

## Features

- **Hono**: A fast, lightweight, and more secure way to build web applications. It's built on top of standard web technologies, such as JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime and package manager. It's designed to run JavaScript and TypeScript projects quickly and efficiently.
- **ESLint**: A static analysis tool for finding problems in your JavaScript code. It can help you catch errors and enforce coding standards.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that can help you ensure your code is consistently styled.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It can help you catch errors at compile time and improve the maintainability of your code.
